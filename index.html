            "\n" +
            "I have worked as a programmer since 2013 and as an iOS developer since 2017. Currently, I am employed by Etraveli Group and help develop their various iOS apps. Earlier, I have worked as a mobile developer for the consulting companies TietoEVRY and Semcon. I started my career at Talkamatic as a software designer with specialty in dialogue systems. Apart from mobile systems I have experience from backend design (mainly in Python) and web frontend design (JS + Angular).\n" +
            "\n" +
            "At a personal level, I sell and maintain KnowTrail for iOS and watchOS and KnowDate for iOS. You can click on the links and download them on your iPhone and/or Apple Watch!\n" +
            "\n" +
            "My academic background is linguistics and computational linguistics and has allowed me to have a more interdisciplinary approach to the art of creating applications and interfaces.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Above all, what drives and defines me is a will to create user-friendly and practical applications that allow the user to focus on the task and not on how to beat the interface.",
    MUSIC: "I am a self-learned musician with two big loves: metal and synth music. Most of the music published is written, executed and produced by me.",
    KNOWTRAIL: "KnowTrail is an amazing application for iPhone, Apple Watch, iPad and Vision Pro that allows you to identify the places and music playing around you and also houses a fun knowledge game.",
    POKE_CALC: "PokeCalc is a small but practical iOS app that allows to track and project your progress in Pokemon GO!",
    JOVIAN_OUTPOST: "From the depths of the solar system an abandoned outpost transmits nostalgic sounds made by synthesized instruments and enhanced by high-energy guitars.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "There are rumors that the people behind these transmissions are based in Gothenburg, Sweden and that their first efforts were manifested under the name Out Of The Circle. \n" +
            "Since then though, they discovered the synthwave scene and set out to combine intense rhythms with atmospheric melodies in their own way.",
    OUT_OF_THE_CIRCLE: "\"During my ever arresting journey through cyberspace, a gold nugget fell at my feet via the undead nation known as Myspace. An unknown musician from Greece, who is currently even alias free, just released a demo for his personal project called Out of The Circle. The name of the demo is pretty straight forward, “Unfinished Samples From A Lo-Fi Hell,” but it belies the complexity of emotion that I’ve found laying within. \n" +
            "\n" +
            "There are two songs that are the crowning jewels of this demo: The first track, “zugzwang,” starts with an interesting sample from the Greek movie The King, also known as O Vasilias, which paves the way for a symphonic ballad permeated with a guitar solo. Using this song as a preset for the rest of the demo, it seems like the electronic additions are the melodic part of this equation. \n" +
            "\n" +
            "The fourth track, “Unfinished Samples From A Lo-Fi Hell,” is hauntingly melancholic with an aggressive edge provided via the harsh vocals and bass. This song is a journey. It’s the progression of emotion that I have while walking through a desolate part of the ghetto alone at night.\"\n" +
            "\n" +
            "- Sarah Elgindy from bloodorlove.com:\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Out Of The Circle started in 2009 in Thessaloniki, Greece. With influences ranging from melodic death metal to thrash metal and crust, an album titled Unfinished Samples From A Lo-Fi Hell was independently released in 2011.\n" +
            "It has now been remastered and released as Out Of The Circle on all music services."
